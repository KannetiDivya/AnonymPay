# AnonymPay
Our project aims to create a facial recognition-based secure and user-friendly authentication method for digital transactions. Our solution moves away from conventional approaches like multi-factor authentication, which are susceptible to phishing and hacking attacks, and instead incorporates the use of facial recognition technology.
# Project Description
Anonym Pay is a groundbreaking mobile application designed to provide secure and anonymous digital transactions, ensuring user privacy. The app addresses the growing concern over personal data security by eliminating the need for users to disclose sensitive information such as phone numbers or bank details during transactions. Anonym Pay integrates advanced facial recognition technology and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for secure account access, while utilizing encryption technologies like bcrypt to protect user data.
